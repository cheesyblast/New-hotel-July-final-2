The previous AI engineer effectively initiated and iteratively developed a comprehensive hotel management application from scratch. The development trajectory demonstrates a strong understanding of user requirements, systematic planning, and meticulous execution across both frontend and backend. Key aspects include leveraging  for rapid initial development, incremental feature addition, and a robust testing protocol involving  and . The AI successfully built core modules like room management, booking workflows, guest profiles, and financial reporting. Debugging, particularly fixing complex UI issues like duplicate navigation and handling data inconsistencies (e.g., date formats), was handled by repeatedly attempting fixes and using  for large refactors. The process shows a clear focus on user experience through real-time updates, dynamic forms, and responsive UI, demonstrating the ability to translate abstract requests into concrete implementations.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a full-stack hotel management application. The dashboard should provide a quick view of room details, recent upcoming bookings, and checked-in customers with a checkout button. Enhancements include:
- Check-in/cancel functionality for upcoming bookings, with real-time updates.
- Modals for check-in (advance amount, notes), cancel (confirmation), and checkout (payable balance, additional amounts, real-time total).
- A New Booking button on the dashboard, opening a modal for guest name, email, phone, room, check-in/out dates.
- A dedicated Rooms page with a card-based layout (image, number, type, price, occupancy, amenities, status) and Add Room modal.
- A Bookings page displaying all bookings with status indicators.
- A Guests page showing unique customer data from bookings, including booking history and statistics.
- A Profit Management system with an Expenses page to add expenses, view daily/monthly income/expenses, and month-to-month comparisons.
- Further enhancements to New Booking modal: horizontally wider, collect ID/Passport, Country, Additional Notes.
- Check-in customer booking should have an edit option to change booking dates (early checkout/advance payment).
- New Booking modal to include Night Stay vs Short Time selection, where Short Time hides checkout date.
- New Booking modal: remove default room price, allow user to enter custom Booking Amount. Make email and phone optional fields.
- New Booking modal layout: Room and Booking Amount on the same row. Booking Amount field should start empty (no default zero).
- Checkout popup: add Discount Amount field below additional charges. Auto-show balance payable in a green box with real-time updates.

<pending_tasks>
- Enhance the checkout popup to remove default zero values from Additional Amount and Discount Amount fields.
- Implement Cash, Card, or Bank Transfer payment options in the checkout popup.
- Ensure all payment details are properly recorded in the database.
- Add the total collected amount from checkout to daily sales records.
- Make the checkout popup horizontally wider for a better visual appearance.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the checkout popup. The previous step (Chat Message 276) successfully implemented a new Discount Amount field below Additional Charges and integrated a real-time, visually prominent green box displaying the Balance Payable (or Refund Due). This calculation dynamically updates as Additional Charges or Discount amounts are entered.

The current task (Chat Message 277-278) involves further refining this checkout popup. Specifically, the user requested:
1.  **Removal of default zeros**: The Additional Amount and Discount Amount input fields should be empty by default, allowing for direct entry without needing to backspace.
2.  **Payment Method Selection**: Introduce options (Cash, Card, Bank Transfer) for selecting the payment type.
3.  **Database Recording**: Ensure the chosen payment method and transaction details are correctly persisted in the database.
4.  **Daily Sales Integration**: The total amount from successful checkouts should be added to the daily sales data for financial reporting.
5.  **Modal Width Adjustment**: Make the checkout popup window slightly wider horizontally for improved aesthetics and layout.

The AI engineer acknowledged these specific requests and planned to implement these enhancements, starting with backend changes for payment method and sales tracking, and then frontend updates for the UI.
